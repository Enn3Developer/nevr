# N Engine Voxel Raytracing

This project is WIP, beware of potential bugs, missing features and not physically-correct rendering.

I started working on this project as a complete graphics newbie so it'll take time to make it decent.

## Goal

A voxel renderer for Bevy that uses raytracing (path tracing) for visibility and physically-based shading.
For a general-purpose raytracer for Bevy,
use [Bevy Solari](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/crates/bevy_solari).
